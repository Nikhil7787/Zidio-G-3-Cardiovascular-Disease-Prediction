# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
### **( Zidio Development Group-3 )** 
Welcome to the official repository for the "Cardiovascular Disease Prediction" project developed by the Zidio Development team. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in individuals, facilitating early detection and preventive measures. </br>


## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model
### Overview
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on various demographic, physical, and medical factors. We have developed an initial machine learning model using the provided dataset and evaluated its performance. The README provides an overview of the model's current performance, our plans for improving accuracy, and our intentions to further develop and deploy the model.</br>
